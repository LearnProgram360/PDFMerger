**Explanation:**

* **PDFMergerUtility**: This class from the PDFBox library allows us to merge multiple PDF files.

* You need to specify the input PDF files (file1.pdf, file2.pdf, file3.pdf), and the program will merge them into a new file named merged_output.pdf.

**Steps to Run the Program:**
1. Add the PDFBox library to your project.
2. Replace the file paths (file1.pdf, file2.pdf, file3.pdf) with the actual paths of the PDF files you want to merge.
3. Compile and run the program.
